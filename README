Django storage for SoftLayer Cloud Storage

This package uses django-cumulus plus softlayer-object-storage-python packages.

To use this storage just import storage class:

    from django_softlayer import SoftLayerStorage

And then you can use it:

   file = models.FileField(storage=SoftLayerStorage())
